# ADR 001: Authentication Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Banking SaaS Application requires a secure, reliable, and scalable authentication system. We need to decide on the authentication strategy that will be used for user management, including registration, login, logout, and session management.

## Decision

We will use Firebase Authentication as our primary authentication provider for the following reasons:

1. **Security**: Firebase Authentication provides industry-standard security practices, including secure password hashing, protection against common attacks, and regular security updates.

2. **Ease of Integration**: Firebase Authentication offers a simple SDK that integrates well with React, our frontend framework.

3. **Scalability**: Firebase Authentication can handle a large number of users and authentication requests without requiring us to manage the infrastructure.

4. **Feature Set**: Firebase Authentication provides a comprehensive set of features, including email/password authentication, social login options, multi-factor authentication, and custom claims for role-based access control.

5. **Cost-Effective**: Firebase Authentication offers a generous free tier and predictable pricing for paid plans, making it cost-effective for our application.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Custom Authentication System

**Pros:**
- Complete control over the authentication process
- No dependency on third-party services
- Can be tailored to specific requirements

**Cons:**
- Requires significant development effort
- Need to implement and maintain security best practices
- Higher risk of security vulnerabilities
- Additional infrastructure costs

### 2. Auth0

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive authentication and authorization solution
- Enterprise-grade security
- Extensive feature set
- Good documentation and support

**Cons:**
- Higher cost compared to Firebase
- More complex integration
- Overkill for our initial requirements

### 3. AWS Cognito

**Pros:**
- Part of the AWS ecosystem
- Scalable and secure
- Good integration with other AWS services

**Cons:**
- More complex setup and configuration
- Steeper learning curve
- Higher cost compared to Firebase

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Rapid Development**: We can implement authentication quickly using Firebase's SDK and pre-built components.

2. **Security**: We benefit from Firebase's security expertise and regular updates.

3. **Scalability**: The authentication system will scale automatically as our user base grows.

4. **Maintenance**: We don't need to maintain our own authentication infrastructure.

5. **Future Expansion**: Firebase Authentication supports various authentication methods, allowing us to add social login, phone authentication, etc., in the future.

### Negative

1. **Vendor Lock-in**: We become dependent on Firebase for authentication.

2. **Cost at Scale**: While the free tier is generous, costs may increase significantly with a large user base.

3. **Limited Customization**: Some advanced customization options may be limited compared to a custom solution.

## Implementation

1. Set up a Firebase project and enable Authentication service.

2. Configure Firebase in the application using the provided credentials.

3. Implement authentication flows using Firebase Authentication SDK:
   - User registration
   - User login
   - User logout
   - Password reset
   - Email verification

4. Implement client-side authentication state management using React Context API.

5. Create protected routes that require authentication.

6. Implement role-based access control using Firebase Authentication custom claims.
