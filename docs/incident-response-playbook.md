| P1 | High - Major functionality unavailable, significant performance degradation | Within 1 hour | Login system down, transaction processing failure |
| P2 | Medium - Limited functionality unavailable, minor performance issues | Within 4 hours | Specific feature not working, slow page loads |
| P3 | Low - Cosmetic issues, non-critical features | Within 24 hours | UI alignment issues, minor bugs |

## Incident Response Team

| Role | Responsibilities | Primary | Backup |
|------|------------------|---------|--------|
| Incident Commander | Overall incident management, stakeholder communication | John Doe | Jane Smith |
| Technical Lead | Technical assessment, solution implementation | Alice Johnson | Bob Williams |
| Communication Lead | Internal and external communications | Sarah Brown | Mike Davis |
| Customer Support Lead | Customer communication, support coordination | Emily Wilson | Tom Anderson |
| Security Lead | Security assessment, compliance verification | David Miller | Lisa Taylor |

## Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Incident Detection and Reporting

#### 1.1 Detection Methods
- Automated monitoring alerts
- Customer support reports
- Team member observations
- User feedback

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment
1. Identify the incident type and severity
2. Determine affected systems and users
3. Document initial observations
4. Assign incident ID using format: `INC-YYYYMMDD-XXX`

#### 1.3 Notification Process
- P0/P1: Immediate notification to all team members via Slack (#incidents) and phone
- P2: Notification to on-call team members via Slack
- P3: Create ticket in issue tracking system

### 2. Incident Response

#### 2.1 Initial Response (P0/P1)
1. Incident Commander activates the response team
2. Technical Lead begins investigation
3. Communication Lead prepares initial status update
4. Customer Support Lead prepares customer communication

#### 2.2 Investigation
1. Technical Lead gathers information about the incident
2. Team members document their findings in the incident channel
3. Identify root cause and potential solutions
4. Assess impact and scope

#### 2.3 Communication
1. Internal communication via Slack (#incidents)
2. External communication via status page
3. Customer communication via email and in-app notifications
4. Regular updates (every 15 minutes for P0, 30 minutes for P1, hourly for P2)

#### 2.4 Resolution
1. Implement fix or workaround
2. Verify the solution
3. Monitor for any side effects
4. Document the resolution

### 3. Post-Incident Procedures

#### 3.1 Recovery
1. Restore normal operations
2. Verify system functionality
3. Communicate resolution to stakeholders
4. Update status page

#### 3.2 Documentation
1. Complete incident report with:
   - Incident ID and severity
   - Timeline of events
   - Root cause analysis
   - Resolution steps
   - Impact assessment
   - Preventive measures

#### 3.3 Review
1. Schedule post-incident review within 48 hours
2. Identify lessons learned
3. Update procedures and documentation
4. Implement preventive measures
