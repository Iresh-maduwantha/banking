# ADR 002: Deployment Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Banking SaaS Application requires a reliable, secure, and efficient deployment strategy. We need to decide on the deployment approach that will be used for releasing new versions of the application, managing different environments, and ensuring high availability.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-environment deployment pipeline with blue-green deployment strategy for the following reasons:

1. **Reliability**: Blue-green deployment allows us to deploy new versions without downtime, ensuring continuous service availability.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: The ability to quickly roll back to the previous version if issues are detected reduces the risk associated with deployments.

3. **Environment Isolation**: Separate environments (development, staging, production) allow for proper testing and validation before releasing to production.

4. **Automation**: Automated deployment pipelines reduce human error and ensure consistent deployment processes.

5. **Scalability**: The chosen strategy scales well as the application grows and can accommodate future requirements.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional Deployment

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation
- Lower initial complexity
- Familiar approach for many developers

**Cons:**
- Downtime during deployments
- Higher risk of deployment failures
- Limited rollback capabilities
- Manual intervention often required

### 2. Canary Deployment

**Pros:**
- Gradual rollout to users
- Early detection of issues
- Minimal impact on all users if problems occur

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires sophisticated traffic routing
- May not be suitable for all types of changes

### 3. Rolling Deployment

**Pros:**
- No downtime
- Simpler than blue-green deployment
- Works well with containerized applications

**Cons:**
- More complex than traditional deployment
- May have inconsistent states during deployment
- Rollback can be more complicated

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Zero Downtime**: Users experience no service interruption during deployments.

2. **Quick Rollback**: If issues are detected, we can quickly switch back to the previous version.

3. **Consistent Environments**: Development, staging, and production environments are consistent, reducing environment-specific issues.

4. **Automated Process**: Reduced human error and consistent deployment process.

5. **Improved Quality**: Better testing and validation before production release.

### Negative

1. **Increased Complexity**: More complex setup and maintenance compared to traditional deployment.

2. **Resource Requirements**: Requires additional resources to maintain multiple environments.

3. **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand and adapt to the new deployment process.

## Implementation

1. Set up three environments:
   - Development: For ongoing development and testing
   - Staging: For pre-production testing and validation
   - Production: For live user traffic

2. Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions:
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Security scanning
   - Deployment to appropriate environments

3. Configure blue-green deployment:
   - Deploy new version to inactive environment
   - Run health checks on new version
   - Switch traffic to new version
   - Keep old version running for rollback capability

4. Implement CDN and edge caching:
   - Configure CDN for static assets
   - Set up cache rules
   - Implement cache invalidation strategy

5. Establish disaster recovery and backup procedures:
   - Regular database backups
   - Automated backup testing
   - Documented recovery procedures
